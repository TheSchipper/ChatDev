# Game Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Gravity Game! This game is a fun and interactive application where you control a larger red circle with a gravitational pull. Your goal is to avoid collisions with smaller circles that continuously spawn and fly around the screen. If any of the smaller circles collide with each other or the larger red circle, they will disappear.

## Installation

To play the Gravity Game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to install the Pygame library, which is used for creating the game graphics and handling user input.
